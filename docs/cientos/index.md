> Cientos (Spanish word for "hundreds", pronounced `/Î¸jentos/` ) is is a collection of useful ready-to-go helpers and components that are not part of the [core](/guide/index.md) package. The name uses the word uses in spanish to multiply by 100, to refer to the potential reach of the package to hold a amazing abstractions.

The `cientos` package uses [`three-stdlib`](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) module under the hood instead of the `three/examples/jsm` module. This means that you don't need to extend the catalogue of components using the `extend` method of the [useCatalogue](/api/composables#useCatalogue) composable, `cientos` does it for you.

It just works. ðŸ’¯

::: info
This package is not required to use the core library, but they can make your DX way better, specially for complex scenes.

```bash
npm install @tresjs/cientos@alpha -D

::: warning
Notice that you don't need to write the prefix `Tres` such as `<TresOrbitControl />` to use the component
